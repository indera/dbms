    $ brew install yarn

        1.22.4
    $ node --version

    $ yarn global add create-react-app
    $ create-react-app app --template typescript

    # Success! Created app at /Volumes/dev/dbms/app/http/web/app
    # Inside that directory, you can run several commands:

    #   yarn start
    #     Starts the development server.

    #   yarn build
    #     Bundles the app into static files for production.

    #   yarn test
    #     Starts the test runner.

    #   yarn eject
    #     Removes this tool and copies build dependencies, configuration files
    #     and scripts into the app directory. If you do this, you canâ€™t go back!

    # We suggest that you begin by typing:

    #   cd app
    #   yarn start

    # Happy hacking!
